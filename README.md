# BoltFN_IsSigma
THIS IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH BOLTFN DEVS, ITS JUST A REMAKE FOR LINUX/TERMUX (remake by gyewtools)


The boltfn checker is in message.py
To add proxies/combos etc, just make new branch from my repo and add ur stuff.
To start, install termux.
Next steps: 
1. pkg install python
2. pkg install git
3. pkg install gh
4. git clone https://github.com/your_user/your_branch
5. cd your_branch
6. pip install -r requirements.txt
7. python message.py
8. Done!

Ofc, before cloning, add your combos to combos folder. After adding new combos/proxies u need to clone again. Repo cant be private when cloning.

Feel free to report issues!
